In a time of multiple and intensifying crises, Progressive Publics is rooted
in a commitment to social justice and asserts that both the academy and the
media are public goods that have crucial and entwined roles to play in critical
analysis and knowledge mobilization and dissemination.

This project triangulates three sectors—independent media, the academy, and
the broader public—through connecting crucial questions of the present and
how to live collectively in more just relation to media and scholarly
communication to promote access, social justice, and community engagement.
